# my-first-website
HTML and CSS files for my first website.

Incomplete, but does contain some basic functionality and formatting. 

Responding to the code review, I have made the following changes: 

    STRUCTURE:  CSS file has been broken into smaller files and reorganised with the use of @import. 
    
    DESIGN:  Typography:  Still lots of imcomplete parts where I would make use of this. But on the index html file I have used <strong> and <em> tags. The footer now contains <small> tags on every html file. 
    
    DESIGN:  Cards:  Cards are now included on the index html file with <figure> and <figcaption> tags.
    
    DESIGN:  About:  About now has a name and title. 
    
    LAYOUT:  CSS Grids:  Grids has been used to style the cards on the index html file. 
    
    QUALITY:  Use of semantic tags such as header, footer, nav in all html files. 
    
    MOBILE VIEWPORT:  Has been fixed, but still using pixels
    
    COLOURS:  There are no longer any 'solid' colours. Now there is mostly rgb/rgba styling.
    
    TEXT:  Font sizes are now only in relative units.
